            <h2>The Original Hero</h2>
            <p>American teenager Peter Parker, a poor sickly orphan, is bitten by a radioactive spider. As a result of
                the bite, he gains superhuman strength, speed, and agility, along with the ability to cling to walls,
                turning him into Spider-Man.</p>

            <h2>The Hero Who Breaks Reality</h2>
            <p>Miles Morales is a teenager from Brooklyn who was bitten by a Genetically Altered Spider and became
                Earth-1610's Spider-Man following the death of that reality's Peter Parker.

                After the Multiverse was destroyed and subsequently rebuilt, Miles Morales, along with his friends and
                family, were transported to Earth-616 and rewritten into that world's history.</p2>
